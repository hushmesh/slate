# Introduction

This is&nbsp;the official documentation of&nbsp;the Hushmesh API.


## What is the&nbsp;Mesh?

The mesh is&nbsp;the "trust network". Much like social networks, the mesh enables digital interactions between people and organizations. But unlike traditional social networks, the mesh does not target a&nbsp;specific application or&nbsp;mode of&nbsp;communication. Rather, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;designed from the ground up&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;neutral platform to&nbsp;enable digital trust and privacy as&nbsp;a&nbsp;service to&nbsp;all other applications, websites, services and devices, for everyone and every organization.


## What you can do as&nbsp;a&nbsp;developer?

You can create applications in&nbsp;the portal and use the mesh for your usecases.
